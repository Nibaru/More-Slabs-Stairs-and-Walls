Expand your building options with More Slabs, Stairs, & Walls. This mod adds slabs, stairs, and walls for blocks that don't have them.

Obtaining:
To obtain the blocks added by this mod, you can use the following methods:
- All slab, stair, and wall blocks can be crafted using the standard recipes (Exception for a few blocks where there are conflicts eg. Snow Slab, Plank Walls, Copper Walls)
- All slab, stair, and wall blocks can be crafted using a stone-cutter
- All blocks are included in the creative inventory

Unique Features:
A unique feature of this mod is that all slabs, stairs, and walls inherit the properties of their parent blocks. For instance;
- Sand, Gravel, and Concrete Powder blocks are affected by gravity.
- Grass spreads to Dirt Slabs, Stairs, and Walls
- Soul Sand and Magma blocks create bubble columns
- Slime Slabs Stairs and Walls will bounce you and are sticky with pistons
- Light blocks will emit light
- Strippabble blocks can be stripped
- Oxidizable blocks will oxidize and can be waxed
- and so on

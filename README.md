### Obtaining:
To obtain the blocks added by this mod, you can use the following methods:

- All slab, stair, and wall blocks can be crafted using a stone-cutter
- All blocks are included in the creative inventory

- Grass spreads to Dirt Slabs, Stairs, and Walls
- Soul Sand and Magma blocks create bubble columns
- Slime Slabs Stairs and Walls will bounce entities and are sticky with pistons
- Light blocks will emit light
- Strippabble blocks can be stripped
- Oxidizable blocks will oxidize and can be waxed
